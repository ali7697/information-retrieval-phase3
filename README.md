# information-retrieval-phase3-1
In this phase, I have implemented the K-nearest-neighbors algorithm to faster retrieve documents from the collection of 50,000 news articles. To do that, I have represented the documents in a vector space using some tricks to reduce the size of the vectors. As a result, the calculation time of the vectors is also considerably reduced.
